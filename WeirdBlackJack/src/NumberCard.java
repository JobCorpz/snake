	//YOU SHOULD NOT ADD ANY ADDITIONAL DATA FIELDS IN EITHER SUBCLASS!
	
	//To complete this class and complete Difficulty #1 you will have to:
	//1. Create the correct constructor so the class can be instantiated
	//2. Override both methods in the superclass with the behaviours expected in the courseworks specification
	
	//Hint: For each of the overriden methods in point 2 you will need to use getter methods you create in the superclass
	//      in order to get access to the data fields. You can use this to both print messages, and solve the "Extra
	//		Complexity" tasks.
		
	//Examples of expected behaviour including this class can be found in Appendix A, B, and C, in the coursework specification
